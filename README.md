### StereoNet: Guided Hierarchical Refinement for Real-Time Edge-Aware Depth prediction model in pytorch. ECCV2018
I will release all the code after I get the best result.
### If you want to communicate with me about the StereoNet, please concact me without hesitating. My email:

### my model result
Now, my model's speed can achieve 60FPS on 540*960 img with the best result of 1.87 EPE_all on sceneflow dataset by end-to-end training. 
the following are the side outputs and the prediction example
